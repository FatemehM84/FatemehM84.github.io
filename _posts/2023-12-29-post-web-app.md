## Goal = An origami app
<h3>explanation about how to make it</h3>

<h4 style= "text-align:left;">
- My topic was completely clear to me, that's why I didn't need to think about it, that's why I started to make it. I have to say it was very hard to find and I preferred to record the videos I wanted. And it was really hard to fix the first video of the site.
<br>
<br>
- In the first attempt, I asked Chat JPT to teach me step-by-step how to set up an application with Django, and I gave him a series of long explanations about my project, which can really be said to be a good start for the first attempt in this field.
<br>
<br>
- This mode was repeated several times until I realized that in order to work with JPT chat you need to explain it step by step so that it can cope with you and give you what you really want and it started from there.
<br>
<br>
- I created my HTML and put it in the template folder and GPT each of my HTML with the help of chat and of course it suggested javascript code to put the data in the table but the goal was to create with the database. And try as I might, I could not redirect the data to the table when it was stored in the database.
<br>
<br>
- I tried to combine and fix them and I made a link for each html and used it in another html.
<br>
<br>
- And finally my program is ready
